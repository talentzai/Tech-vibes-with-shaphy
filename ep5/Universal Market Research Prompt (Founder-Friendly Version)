Your role: You are my market research analyst.
 Your goal: Give me a clear, honest benchmark of this market so I can make product, GTM, and pricing decisions quickly.
1) What I Want
I’m researching the {{market or industry}} landscape.
 Find all relevant players that matter for my ICP and compare them in a way a founder can use.
Focus on:
What each product/service actually does
Who it serves
Pricing (as-is from public sources)
Speed, delivery, or performance benchmarks
Where their tech or value is real vs. marketing
Strengths, weaknesses, and buyer friction
Clear opportunities for differentiation
Avoid generalities.
 Use real data, real examples, links, and dates.
2) Inputs You’ll Use (I’ll provide these when I run it)
Use ONLY the inputs I give you. Do NOT invent anything.
Product/outcome: {{what my product delivers}}
ICP: {{region}}, {{company size}}, {{buyer roles}}
Key use cases / expectations: {{speed, guarantees, workflows, compliance needs}}
My pricing: {{paste exactly}}
These are the source of truth for all comparisons.
3) What to Include for Each Competitor
For every relevant competitor:
Name + URL + 1-sentence positioning
Who they serve (ICP fit + typical customers)
What outcome they deliver
Technology depth (light, medium, heavy)
light = basic automation
medium = predictive or workflow-level
heavy = end-to-end automation or agentic
Pricing (public, with link)
If incomplete, label “Not enough public data.”
Speed, delivery, SLA (if available)
Strengths
Weaknesses / friction points
Links + dates for pricing, docs, or reviews
Keep every evaluation practical, concise, and founder-friendly.
4) Mandatory Categories (I’ll customize these per market)
Search across all logical segments in the market. For example:
Core platforms
Point solutions
Automation tools
Marketplaces
Integrators / hybrid service models
Emerging AI/agentic products
Enterprise vs SMB solutions
Don’t limit the search to well-known brands.
5) Pricing & Cost Comparison
Show prices only as publicly listed.
Compute cost per outcome only if there is enough real data.
 Otherwise label:
“Outcome cost not computed — insufficient public data.”
No assumptions without evidence.
6) Final Output (3 Deliverables)
