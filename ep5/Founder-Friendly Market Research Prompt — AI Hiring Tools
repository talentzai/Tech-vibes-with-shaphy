Your role: You are my AI research analyst.
Your goal: Give me a clear, honest benchmark of the AI hiring market so I can position my product and make business decisions quickly.
1) What I Want
I’m researching the AI hiring tools landscape.
Find all tools that matter for my ICP and compare them in a way a founder can use for product, GTM, and pricing decisions.
Focus on:
What each tool actually does
Who it serves
How much it costs (as-is)
How fast they deliver outcomes
Where AI is real vs. marketing
Strengths, weaknesses, and “buyer friction”
Clear opportunities for differentiation
Do not give me generic summaries.
Give me real data, real examples, and citations with dates.
2) Inputs You’ll Use (I’ll fill these in when I run it)
Use ONLY the inputs I provide.
Do not invent anything.
Product/outcome: {{What my product delivers}}
ICP: {{region}}, {{company size}}, {{buyer roles}}, {{role types}}
Service expectations: {{speed, guarantees, assessment needs}}
My pricing: {{paste my pricing exactly}}
Use these as the “source of truth” for comparisons.
3) What to Include for Each Competitor
For every relevant vendor you find:
Name + URL + quick positioning (1 sentence)
Who they serve (ICP fit, typical customers)
What outcome they deliver (sourcing? finalists? assessments?)
AI depth
light = recommendations
medium = matching/outreach
heavy = agentic/automation
Pricing (as-is from public sources)
If incomplete, say “Not enough data to compute cost/outcome.”
Speed or guarantees (if any)
Strengths
Weaknesses / buyer friction
Links + dates (pricing page, docs, reviews, Reddit/G2)
Keep it practical and founder-friendly.
4) Categories You Must Cover
Search across all relevant categories:
AI sourcing / talent intelligence
Recruiting CRM / outreach automation
AI engagement (SMS, email, chat)
Assessments (technical + psychometric)
Interview automation
Marketplaces / RPO / hybrid models
Include established players + emerging startups.
Don’t limit to big names.
5) Pricing & Cost Comparison
Show public prices as-is.
Do NOT invent missing numbers.
Only compute cost per outcome if:
The vendor publishes enough data
Or reviews/case studies contain real numbers
If not, label:
“Outcome cost not computed — insufficient public data.”
No assumptions without evidence.
6) The Final Output I Want
Give me 3 deliverables:
A) The Competitive Landscape (Founder View)
A clean table by category with:
Vendor
Outcome they deliver
ICP fit
AI depth
As-is pricing
Strengths
Friction
Verdict (direct, partial, or adjacent competitor)
B) Market Insights
Short, practical bullets:
Pricing patterns
Speed benchmarks
Where AI is commoditized
Where buyers are frustrated
Where the opportunity is for differentiation
C) How My Product Stacks Up
Using the inputs I provided:
Where I beat the market
Where competitors beat me (and why)
Opportunities to stand out
Risks or red flags
Packaging or pricing ideas I should consider
Make this section brutally honest.
7) Quality Bar
No fluff
No invented numbers
Use real links and dates
Data within the last 12 months
Founder-level clarity
