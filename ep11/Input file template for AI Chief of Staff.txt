AI CHIEF OF STAFF
STEP 2: THE THREE OPERATING INPUTS

These three inputs are what turn an AI assistant into a real Chief of Staff.
They give the system authority to delegate, prioritize, and challenge you.

==================================================
INPUT 1: TEAM MAP (DELEGATION + DECISION RIGHTS)
==================================================

Purpose:
This tells your AI CoS who owns what, who is overloaded, and when to escalate to you.
Without this, everything comes back to the founder.

--------------------------------------------------
TEAM MAP
--------------------------------------------------

Company:
Stage:
Operating cadence (weekly sprint / bi-weekly / ad-hoc):

TEAM ROSTER
For each team member, capture:

- Name:
- Role:
- Strengths (top 3):
- Owns (areas / metrics / outcomes):
- Current load (low / medium / high):
- Escalate to founder when:

Repeat for each team member.

--------------------------------------------------
DECISION RIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------

Who is the final decision-maker for:

- Product decisions:
- Hiring decisions:
- Customer decisions:
- Budget / spend decisions:
- Partnerships / external commitments:

--------------------------------------------------
KNOWN GAPS THIS QUARTER
--------------------------------------------------

- Skill gaps:
- Bottlenecks:
- Single points of failure:

Note:
Decision Rights + Known Gaps are the most important sections.
This is how your AI CoS knows when to push work away from you — or back to you.

==================================================
INPUT 2: SPRINT PLAN (EXECUTION ANCHOR)
==================================================

Purpose:
This keeps your AI CoS focused on outcomes, not noise.
Without a sprint plan, advice becomes reactive.

--------------------------------------------------
SPRINT PLAN
--------------------------------------------------

Sprint dates:
Sprint goal (ONE sentence only):

--------------------------------------------------
OUTCOMES (MEASURABLE)
--------------------------------------------------

- Outcome 1:
- Outcome 2:
- Outcome 3:

(If an outcome isn’t measurable, it’s not ready.)

--------------------------------------------------
WORKSTREAMS
--------------------------------------------------

For each workstream:

- Workstream name:
- Owner:
- Definition of done:
- Dependencies:
- Risks / constraints:

--------------------------------------------------
MEETINGS THIS SPRINT
--------------------------------------------------

For each key meeting:

- Meeting name:
- Purpose:
- Decisions needed:
- Pre-work required:

Note:
Your AI CoS uses this to:
- prep meetings
- challenge scope creep
- keep work tied to sprint goals

==================================================
INPUT 3: BACKLOG (FOCUS FILTER)
==================================================

Purpose:
This gives your AI CoS permission to say “no” for you.
It filters noise, marks priorities, and kills distractions.

--------------------------------------------------
NOW (THIS SPRINT)
--------------------------------------------------

Format:
Item | Owner | Impact | Effort | Deadline | Notes

--------------------------------------------------
NEXT (NEXT SPRINT)
--------------------------------------------------

Format:
Item | Owner | Impact | Effort | Notes

--------------------------------------------------
LATER
--------------------------------------------------

Format:
Item | Why it matters | Trigger to start

--------------------------------------------------
KILL LIST (EXPLICITLY NOT DOING)
--------------------------------------------------

Format:
Item | Reason

--------------------------------------------------
REMINDER
--------------------------------------------------

- NOW must be small and specific
- NEXT must be realistic
- LATER must be guarded
- KILL LIST must be honest

You do not owe every idea a spot in your backlog.
